Healthier planet, healthier people Is snuff really safer than smoking? Will miscarriage care remain available? / Staying Healthy Healthy lifestyle: 5 keys to a longer life March 25, 2020 By Monique Tello, MD, MPH, Contributor How is it that the United States spends the most money on healthcare, and yet still has the one of the lowest life expectancies of all developed nations? (To be specific: $9,400 per capita, 79 years, and 31st.) Maybe those of us in healthcare have been looking at it all wrong, for too long. Healthy lifestyle and longevity Researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health conducted a massive study of the impact of health habits on life expectancy, using data from the well-known Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS). This means that they had data on a huge number of people over a very long period of time. The NHS included over 78,000 women and followed them from 1980 to 2014. The HPFS included over 40,000 men and followed them from 1986 to 2014. This is over 120,000 participants, 34 years of data for women, and 28 years of data for men. The researchers looked at NHS and HPFS data on diet, physical activity, body weight, smoking, and alcohol consumption that had been collected from regularly administered, validated questionnaires. What is a healthy lifestyle, exactly? These five areas were chosen because prior studies have shown them to have a large impact on risk of premature death. Here is how these healthy habits were defined and measured: 1. Healthy diet, which was calculated and rated based on the reported intake of healthy foods like vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, healthy fats, and omega-3 fatty acids, and unhealthy foods like red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages, trans fat, and sodium. 2. Healthy physical activity level, which was measured as at least 30 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous activity daily. 3. Healthy body weight, defined as a normal body mass index (BMI), which is between 18.5 and 24.9. 4. Smoking, well, there is no healthy amount of smoking. "Healthy" here meant never having smoked. 5. Moderate alcohol intake, which was measured as between 5 and 15 grams per day for women, and 5 to 30 grams per day for men. Generally, one drink contains about 14 grams of pure alcohol. That's 12 ounces of regular beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits. Researchers also looked at data on age, ethnicity, and medication use, as well as comparison data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research. Does a healthy lifestyle make a difference? As it turns out, healthy habits make a big difference. According to this analysis, people who met criteria for all five habits enjoyed significantly, impressively longer lives than those who had none: 14 years for women and 12 years for men (if they had these habits at age 50). People who had none of these habits were far more likely to die prematurely from cancer or cardiovascular disease. Study investigators also calculated life expectancy by how many of these five healthy habits people had. Just one healthy habit (and it didn't matter which one) ... just one... extended life expectancy by two years in men and women. Not surprisingly, the more healthy habits people had, the longer their lifespan. This is one of those situations where I wish I could reprint their graphs for you, because they're so cool. (But if you're very curious, the article is available online, and the graphs are on page 7. Check out Graph B, "Estimated life expectancy at age 50 according to the number of low-risk factors.") This is huge. And, it confirms prior similar research a lot of prior similar research. A 2017 study using data from the Health and Retirement Study found that people 50 and older who were normal weight, had never smoked, and drank alcohol in moderation lived on average seven years longer. A 2012 mega-analysis of 15 international studies that included over 500,000 participants found that over half of premature deaths were due to unhealthy lifestyle factors such as poor diet, inactivity, obesity, excessive alcohol intake, and smoking. And the list of supporting research goes on. So what's our (big) problem? As the authors of this study point out, in the US we tend to spend outlandishly on developing fancy drugs and other treatments for diseases, rather than on trying to prevent them. This is a big problem. Experts have suggested that the best way to help people make healthy diet and lifestyle change is at the large-scale, population level, through public health efforts and policy changes. (Kind of like motorcycle helmets and seat belt legislation...) We have made a little progress with tobacco and trans-fat legislation. There's a lot of pushback from big industry on that, of course. If we have guidelines and laws helping us to live healthier, big companies aren't going to sell as much fast food, chips, and soda. And for companies hell-bent on making money at the cost of human life, well, that makes them very angry.

You may simply feel off. You may find that you feel tired, your digestive system isnt functioning as well as it normally does, and you seem to catch colds. Mentally, you may find you cant concentrate and feel anxious or depressed.The good news: a healthy lifestyle can help you feel better. Even better, you dont have to overhaul your entire life overnight. Its pretty easy to make a couple of small changes that can steer you in the direction of improved well-being. And once you make one change, that success can motivate you to continue to make more positive shifts.What is a healthy lifestyle?Ask 50 people to define what a healthy lifestyle is, and youll likely get 50 different answers. Thats because theres no one way to be healthy. A healthy lifestyle simply means doing things that make you happy and feel good.For one person, that may mean walking a mile five times a week, eating fast food once a week, and spending virtual or in-person time with loved ones every other day. For someone else, a healthy lifestyle may be training and running two marathons a year, following a keto diet, and never having a sip of alcohol.Neither of these is better than the other. Both are perfect for that person. You get to decide what your healthy lifestyle looks like.How is it beneficial?Making changes to improve your health can lead to benefits for your body, your mind, your wallet, and even the environment.1. Prevents diseaseHealthy habits can reduce the risk of various diseases, including those that may run in your family.For example, in a recent study, adults who followed a standard American diet (rich in fruits and vegetables) for 8 weeks had a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.In another 2020 study, researchers found that every 66-gram increase in daily fruit and vegetable intake was associated with a 25 percent lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes.Swapping out some refined grains for whole grains also reduces the risk of disease. In an observational study of almost 200,000 adults, those who ate the most whole grains had a 29 percent lower rate of type 2 diabetes than those who ate the least.And a review of 45 studies concluded that eating 90 grams (or three 30-gram servings) of whole grains daily reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease by 22 percent, coronary heart disease by 19 percent, and cancer by 15 percent.In terms of exercise, as little as 11 minutes a day may add years to your life. In a 2020 study, researchers tracked more than 44,000 adults. Those who got 11 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity each day had a lower risk of death compared to those who only exercised at that intensity for 2 minutes. This comparison held true even if people sat for 8.5 hours every day.2. Saves moneyIts always smart to see your primary care physician for an annual physical exam. This is especially true seeing how some health conditions, such as high blood pressure, are silent. This means they dont have any symptoms, so unless you are checked, you usually dont know you have the condition.However, the healthier you are, the less likely you will have to see a doctor. This could save money by reducing co-pays, the need for prescriptions, and other treatments.3. Lengthens lifespanBasic healthy habits are connected with living a longer life. If, at age 50, youve never smoked, maintain a healthy weight, are regularly active, follow a healthy diet, and keep alcohol to a moderate consumption, you could live up to 14 years longer. Making even a few of these changes could lengthen your lifespan.4. It can be good for the environmentUltra-processed foods are those that contain refined grains and additives to change the texture, taste, or color. Some examples of these foods are cheese puffs, packaged dessert cakes, chicken nuggets, and sweetened breakfast cereals. More than 70 percent of foods in U.S. supermarkets are ultra-processed.The making of ultra-processed foods contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, water scarcity, decreased biodiversity, plastic waste, and deforestation.Then, there are animal products. According to a 2013 study by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (an agency within the U.N. that focuses on reducing hunger and food inequality worldwide), raising livestock for meat and dairy makes up 14.5 percent of human-created greenhouse gases. However, there are easy fixes for this. For example, if every American cut their weekly beef consumption by 1/4 pound, the decrease in global warming gas emissions would be the equivalent of taking four to six million cars off the road, according to the National Resources Defense Council.But its not only about what you eat more or less of. Replacing short car rides with biking can also cut back on the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere.In a non-peer reviewed 2010 study, researchers estimated that if 20 percent of citizens in Madison, Wisconsin biked for trips less than 5 miles, it would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 57,000 tons each year.And, a 2017 study in Stockholm found that, if drivers who lived within a half-hour bike ride to and from work commuted by bike rather than car, it could save 449 years of life annually in the county due to reduced vehicle emission.These estimates arent simply dreams. Barcelonas bike-share program reduces emissions of carbon dioxide by about 10,000 tons each year.What is the easiest way to start one?Your journey toward a healthier lifestyle starts with small changes that you feel confident you can achieve. Consider making SMART goals. SMART stands for:specificmeasurableattainablerelevanttime-bound (met by a deadline and done in a certain amount of time)When you focus on SMART goals, you could find more success. And one initial win will propel you to set new, bigger goals.Consider the following tips for beginning to improve your overall health.1. Eat more vegetablesA 2010 analysis of prospective studies suggests consuming more veggies and fruit is associated with lower risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, and premature death.Although eating more vegetables is better, you dont have to go from zero to nine servings a day. Perhaps your goal is eating one serving of vegetables at dinner. If you already do that, consider eating one vegetable or fruit at every meal.Keep in mind that less-processed veggies are better. Rather than fries, try roasted potatoes seasoned with herbs or make a stir-fry of several colorful vegetables and drizzle them with a tasty vinaigrette.2. Swap in whole grainsReplacing refined grains with whole grains will benefit your health. In a small 2017 study, 81 men and postmenopausal women were divided into two groups. Half followed a diet that contained whole grains, and the other half followed a diet that was calorically the same but contained refined grains. After 6 weeks, the whole grain group increased their resting metabolic rate (RMR). RMR is how many calories your body burns at rest.Research from 2016 and 2020 link consuming more whole grains with reduced risk of diabetes, coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.Start small by replacing one refined grain each day with a whole grain maybe its your breakfast toast or the pilaf you make with dinner. Experiment with different grains and flavorings to see which ones you enjoy most.Whole grains include:plain oatswhole grain bread and pastabrown and wild ricebuckwheatbulgur wheatmilletbarleyspeltquinoafarroRefined grains include:white bread and pastawhite ricemost breakfast cerealschipspretzelcrackers3. Be more activeIf the words exercise or workout put you off, think of this step in terms of physical activity or simply moving your body. You dont have to run a marathon or run at all to be healthy.You could walk, go for a bike ride, take salsa dancing lessons, practice martial arts, or try a workout class online. The most important thing is to choose an activity you enjoy. Choosing an activity you have an interest in will increase the chances that youll stick with it.Secondly, remember that you dont have to start with a long workout. Aim for 10 minutes a day, 5 days a week. When you feel ready, add another 5 or 10 minutes. Keep doing this until you reach at least 30 minutes a day most days of the week.4. Maintain friendshipsStrong relationships and staying in communication with friends and loved ones can support mental health.For one, the risk of depression is greater in people with low-quality relationships. Those with the poorest quality social relationships have more than double the risk of depression compared to people with the highest quality connections.Similarly, research suggests feeling isolated is associated with an increased risk of poor self-rated health and depression. It is also associated with various health problems, like headaches, palpitations, and lower back, neck, or shoulder pain.Even if you cannot get together with friends or family in person, schedule a time to catch up over a phone or video call once a week. Or, simply start chatting with a neighbor when you see them.5. Control stressChronic stress puts your body into fight-or-flight mode all the time. This taxes your immune system and makes you more susceptible to health problems, including:heart diseasediabetesdigestive problemsdepressionhigh blood pressureanxietydifficulty sleepingExercise can help reduce stress by releasing pent-up energy. Physical activity can also boost the release of mood-lifting hormones called endorphins.For others, mindfulness practices like meditation, deep breathing, journaling, or spending time in nature can help to lower stress. Talking to friends can also help.If you would like more support relieving stress, consider therapy. Working with a trained psychologist, psychiatrist, or therapist can help you work through challenges life throws your way, and it can help you learn new skills to manage stress.Are there any drawbacks?There really arent any downsides to a healthy lifestyle since each person gets to define what healthy looks and feels like for themselves.This means you dont have to do anything that doesnt make you happy. After all, as we already covered, unhappiness can affect your health. For example, if you dont like conventional exercise, think of ways you enjoy moving your body. And if you hate kale, you dont have to eat it.Does this mean I have to give up my favorite bad habit?Living a healthy lifestyle does not mean you have to give up the things that may be considered bad habits. Its perfectly possible to balance healthy living with eating cookies, taking a day off from your workout, or having wine with dinner.In fact, enjoying a treat once in a while can help you better stick to healthy eating habits. An all-or-nothing mindset where you can only eat good foods and never eat bad ones often backfires. Having the flexibility to eat your moms extra-cheesy lasagna and savor every bite is part of being healthy.Rest days are also important for physical and mental health. Doing too much exercise can increase the risk of injuries or cause you to burn out and give up exercise altogether.Furthermore, moderate drinking (one standard-size drink per day for women and two for men) is linked with various health benefits. A standard drink is:12 fluid ounces of beer5 fl oz of wine89 fl oz of malt liquor1.5 fl oz of spiritOn the other hand, if you feel as though you cant control a habit that might bring negative health effects (such as drinking alcohol, using recreational drugs in excess, or smoking), talk to your doctor. They can help you find support.The bottom lineA healthy lifestyle can not only help you feel better, but it can also reduce the risk of some diseases, lengthen your lifespan, save you money, and benefit the environment.Your version of a healthy lifestyle is whatever you define it to be. Theres nothing you must or must not do in order to be healthy. Identify what makes you feel good and what brings you the greatest happiness. Then, start small when you make changes. Youre more likely to see success this way, and small successes will snowball into bigger benefits.Lastly, if you want help with making any lifestyle changes, talk to your doctor. If they cant directly help you, they may recommend other professionals, like registered dietitians or therapists.Brittany Risher is a writer, editor, and digital strategist specializing in health and lifestyle content.

Being healthy includes healthy eating, physical activities, weight management, and stress management. A healthy lifestyle includes a balanced diet. This does not mean cutting out important food groups from your diet or limiting yourself on the amount of calories per day. A well-rounded diet involves eating most food groups in every meal. Meats, dairy, fruits, and vegetables are all important components of a meal that will ensure your body is healthy. Components of a healthy lifestyle[change | change source] A healthy lifestyle is mostly associated with: Good diet Physical exercise Good sleeping pattern Personal hygiene No bad habits or addiction Health education Safe environment Physical fitness Love through social support and healthy relationships Emotions Active social life References[change | change source] Participants at the 6th Global Conference on Health Promotion.

Eat a variety of foods For good health, we need more than 40 different nutrients, and no single food can supply them all. It is not about a single meal, it is about a balanced food choice over time that will make a difference!A high-fat lunch could be followed by a low-fat dinner.After a large meat portion at dinner, perhaps fish should be the next days choice?Top of the page2. Base your diet on plenty of foods rich in carbohydratesAbout half the calories in our diet should come from foods rich in carbohydrates, such as cereals, rice, pasta, potatoes, and bread. It is a good idea to include at least one of these at every meal. Wholegrain foods, like wholegrain bread, pasta, and cereals, will increase our fibre intake.Top of the page 3. Replace saturated with unsaturated fatFats are important for good health and proper functioning of the body. However, too much of it can negatively affect our weight and cardiovascular health. Different kinds of fats have different health effects, and some of these tips could help us keep the balance right:We should limit the consumption of total and saturated fats (often coming from foods of animal origin), and completely avoid trans fats; reading the labels helps to identify the sources.Eating fish 2-3 times a week, with at least one serving of oily fish, will contribute to our right intake of unsaturated fats.When cooking, we should boil, steam or bake, rather than frying, remove the fatty part of meat, use vegetable oils.Top of the page4. Enjoy plenty of fruits and vegetablesFruits and vegetables are among the most important foods for giving us enough vitamins, minerals and fibre. We should try to eat at least 5 servings a day. For example, a glass of fresh fruit juice at breakfast, perhaps an apple and a piece of watermelon as snacks, and a good portion of different vegetables at each meal.Top of the page5. Reduce salt and sugar intakeA high salt intake can result in high blood pressure, and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. There are different ways to reduce salt in the diet:When shopping, we could choose products with lower sodium content.When cooking, salt can be substituted with spices, increasing the variety of flavours and tastes.When eating, it helps not to have salt at the table, or at least not to add salt before tasting.Sugar provides sweetness and an attractive taste, but sugary foods and drinks are rich in energy, and are best enjoyed in moderation, as an occasional treat. We could use fruits instead, even to sweeten our foods and drinks.Top of the page6. Eat regularly, control the portion sizeEating a variety of foods, regularly, and in the right amounts is the best formula for a healthy diet.Skipping meals, especially breakfast, can lead to out-of-control hunger, often resulting in helpless overeating. Snacking between meals can help control hunger, but snacking should not replace proper meals. For snacks, we could choose yoghurt, a handful of fresh or dried fruits or vegetables (like carrot sticks), unsalted nuts, or perhaps some bread with cheese.Paying attention to portion size will help us not to consume too much calories, and will allow us to eat all the foods we enjoy, without having to eliminate any.Cooking the right amount makes it easier to not overeat.Some reasonable serving sizes are: 100 g of meat; one medium piece of fruit; half a cup of raw pasta.Using smaller plates helps with smaller servings.Packaged foods, with calorie values on the pack, could aid portion control.If eating out, we could share a portion with a friend.Top of the page7. Drink plenty of fluidsAdults need to drink at least 1.5 litres of fluid a day! Or more if it's very hot or they are physically active. Water is the best source, of course, and we can use tap or mineral water, sparkling or non-sparkling, plain or flavoured. Fruit juices, tea, soft drinks, milk and other drinks, can all be okay - from time to time.Top of the page8. Maintain a healthy body weightThe right weight for each us depends on factors like our gender, height, age, and genes. Being affected by obesity and overweight increases the risks of a wide range of diseases, including diabetes, heart diseases, and cancer.Excess body fat comes from eating more than we need. The extra calories can come from any caloric nutrient - protein, fat, carbohydrate, or alcohol, but fat is the most concentrated source of energy. Physical activity helps us spend the energy, and makes us feel good. The message is reasonably simple: if we are gaining weight, we need to eat less and be more active!Top of the page9. Get on the move, make it a habit!Physical activity is important for people of all weight ranges and health conditions. It helps us burn off the extra calories, it is good for the heart and circulatory system, it maintains or increases our muscle mass, it helps us focus, and improves overall health well-being. We don't have to be top athletes to get on the move! 150 minutes per week of moderate physical activity is advised, and it can easily become part of our daily routine. We all could:use the stairs instead of the elevator,go for a walk during lunch breaks (and stretch in our offices in between)make time for a family weekend activityTop of the page10. Start now! And keep changing gradually.Gradual changes in our lifestyle are easier to maintain than major changes introduced all at once. For three days, we could write down the foods and drinks we consume throughout the day, and make a note of the amount of movement we made. It wont be difficult to spot where we could improve:Skipping breakfast? A small bowl of muesli, a piece of bread or fruit, could help slowly introduce it into our routineToo few fruits and vegetables? To start with, we can introduce one extra piece a day.Favourite foods high in fat? Eliminating them abruptly could fire back, and make us return to the old habits. We can choose low fat options instead, eat them less frequently, and in smaller portions.Too little activity? Using the stairs daily could be a great first move.Top of the page You may also like...

Healthier planet, healthier people Is snuff really safer than smoking? Will miscarriage care remain available? / Staying Healthy Healthy lifestyle: 5 keys to a longer life March 25, 2020 By Monique Tello, MD, MPH, Contributor How is it that the United States spends the most money on healthcare, and yet still has the one of the lowest life expectancies of all developed nations? (To be specific: $9,400 per capita, 79 years, and 31st.) Maybe those of us in healthcare have been looking at it all wrong, for too long. Healthy lifestyle and longevity Researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health conducted a massive study of the impact of health habits on life expectancy, using data from the well-known Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS). This means that they had data on a huge number of people over a very long period of time. The NHS included over 78,000 women and followed them from 1980 to 2014. The HPFS included over 40,000 men and followed them from 1986 to 2014. This is over 120,000 participants, 34 years of data for women, and 28 years of data for men. The researchers looked at NHS and HPFS data on diet, physical activity, body weight, smoking, and alcohol consumption that had been collected from regularly administered, validated questionnaires. What is a healthy lifestyle, exactly? These five areas were chosen because prior studies have shown them to have a large impact on risk of premature death. Here is how these healthy habits were defined and measured: 1. Healthy diet, which was calculated and rated based on the reported intake of healthy foods like vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, healthy fats, and omega-3 fatty acids, and unhealthy foods like red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages, trans fat, and sodium. 2. Healthy physical activity level, which was measured as at least 30 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous activity daily. 3. Healthy body weight, defined as a normal body mass index (BMI), which is between 18.5 and 24.9. 4. Smoking, well, there is no healthy amount of smoking. "Healthy" here meant never having smoked. 5. Moderate alcohol intake, which was measured as between 5 and 15 grams per day for women, and 5 to 30 grams per day for men. Generally, one drink contains about 14 grams of pure alcohol. That's 12 ounces of regular beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits. Researchers also looked at data on age, ethnicity, and medication use, as well as comparison data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research. Does a healthy lifestyle make a difference? As it turns out, healthy habits make a big difference. According to this analysis, people who met criteria for all five habits enjoyed significantly, impressively longer lives than those who had none: 14 years for women and 12 years for men (if they had these habits at age 50). People who had none of these habits were far more likely to die prematurely from cancer or cardiovascular disease. Study investigators also calculated life expectancy by how many of these five healthy habits people had. Just one healthy habit (and it didn't matter which one) ... just one... extended life expectancy by two years in men and women. Not surprisingly, the more healthy habits people had, the longer their lifespan. This is one of those situations where I wish I could reprint their graphs for you, because they're so cool. (But if you're very curious, the article is available online, and the graphs are on page 7. Check out Graph B, "Estimated life expectancy at age 50 according to the number of low-risk factors.") This is huge. And, it confirms prior similar research a lot of prior similar research. A 2017 study using data from the Health and Retirement Study found that people 50 and older who were normal weight, had never smoked, and drank alcohol in moderation lived on average seven years longer. A 2012 mega-analysis of 15 international studies that included over 500,000 participants found that over half of premature deaths were due to unhealthy lifestyle factors such as poor diet, inactivity, obesity, excessive alcohol intake, and smoking. And the list of supporting research goes on. So what's our (big) problem? As the authors of this study point out, in the US we tend to spend outlandishly on developing fancy drugs and other treatments for diseases, rather than on trying to prevent them. This is a big problem. Experts have suggested that the best way to help people make healthy diet and lifestyle change is at the large-scale, population level, through public health efforts and policy changes. (Kind of like motorcycle helmets and seat belt legislation...) We have made a little progress with tobacco and trans-fat legislation. There's a lot of pushback from big industry on that, of course. If we have guidelines and laws helping us to live healthier, big companies aren't going to sell as much fast food, chips, and soda. And for companies hell-bent on making money at the cost of human life, well, that makes them very angry.

You may simply feel off. You may find that you feel tired, your digestive system isnt functioning as well as it normally does, and you seem to catch colds. Mentally, you may find you cant concentrate and feel anxious or depressed.The good news: a healthy lifestyle can help you feel better. Even better, you dont have to overhaul your entire life overnight. Its pretty easy to make a couple of small changes that can steer you in the direction of improved well-being. And once you make one change, that success can motivate you to continue to make more positive shifts.What is a healthy lifestyle?Ask 50 people to define what a healthy lifestyle is, and youll likely get 50 different answers. Thats because theres no one way to be healthy. A healthy lifestyle simply means doing things that make you happy and feel good.For one person, that may mean walking a mile five times a week, eating fast food once a week, and spending virtual or in-person time with loved ones every other day. For someone else, a healthy lifestyle may be training and running two marathons a year, following a keto diet, and never having a sip of alcohol.Neither of these is better than the other. Both are perfect for that person. You get to decide what your healthy lifestyle looks like.How is it beneficial?Making changes to improve your health can lead to benefits for your body, your mind, your wallet, and even the environment.1. Prevents diseaseHealthy habits can reduce the risk of various diseases, including those that may run in your family.For example, in a recent study, adults who followed a standard American diet (rich in fruits and vegetables) for 8 weeks had a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.In another 2020 study, researchers found that every 66-gram increase in daily fruit and vegetable intake was associated with a 25 percent lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes.Swapping out some refined grains for whole grains also reduces the risk of disease. In an observational study of almost 200,000 adults, those who ate the most whole grains had a 29 percent lower rate of type 2 diabetes than those who ate the least.And a review of 45 studies concluded that eating 90 grams (or three 30-gram servings) of whole grains daily reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease by 22 percent, coronary heart disease by 19 percent, and cancer by 15 percent.In terms of exercise, as little as 11 minutes a day may add years to your life. In a 2020 study, researchers tracked more than 44,000 adults. Those who got 11 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity each day had a lower risk of death compared to those who only exercised at that intensity for 2 minutes. This comparison held true even if people sat for 8.5 hours every day.2. Saves moneyIts always smart to see your primary care physician for an annual physical exam. This is especially true seeing how some health conditions, such as high blood pressure, are silent. This means they dont have any symptoms, so unless you are checked, you usually dont know you have the condition.However, the healthier you are, the less likely you will have to see a doctor. This could save money by reducing co-pays, the need for prescriptions, and other treatments.3. Lengthens lifespanBasic healthy habits are connected with living a longer life. If, at age 50, youve never smoked, maintain a healthy weight, are regularly active, follow a healthy diet, and keep alcohol to a moderate consumption, you could live up to 14 years longer. Making even a few of these changes could lengthen your lifespan.4. It can be good for the environmentUltra-processed foods are those that contain refined grains and additives to change the texture, taste, or color. Some examples of these foods are cheese puffs, packaged dessert cakes, chicken nuggets, and sweetened breakfast cereals. More than 70 percent of foods in U.S. supermarkets are ultra-processed.The making of ultra-processed foods contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, water scarcity, decreased biodiversity, plastic waste, and deforestation.Then, there are animal products. According to a 2013 study by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (an agency within the U.N. that focuses on reducing hunger and food inequality worldwide), raising livestock for meat and dairy makes up 14.5 percent of human-created greenhouse gases. However, there are easy fixes for this. For example, if every American cut their weekly beef consumption by 1/4 pound, the decrease in global warming gas emissions would be the equivalent of taking four to six million cars off the road, according to the National Resources Defense Council.But its not only about what you eat more or less of. Replacing short car rides with biking can also cut back on the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere.In a non-peer reviewed 2010 study, researchers estimated that if 20 percent of citizens in Madison, Wisconsin biked for trips less than 5 miles, it would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 57,000 tons each year.And, a 2017 study in Stockholm found that, if drivers who lived within a half-hour bike ride to and from work commuted by bike rather than car, it could save 449 years of life annually in the county due to reduced vehicle emission.These estimates arent simply dreams. Barcelonas bike-share program reduces emissions of carbon dioxide by about 10,000 tons each year.What is the easiest way to start one?Your journey toward a healthier lifestyle starts with small changes that you feel confident you can achieve. Consider making SMART goals. SMART stands for:specificmeasurableattainablerelevanttime-bound (met by a deadline and done in a certain amount of time)When you focus on SMART goals, you could find more success. And one initial win will propel you to set new, bigger goals.Consider the following tips for beginning to improve your overall health.1. Eat more vegetablesA 2010 analysis of prospective studies suggests consuming more veggies and fruit is associated with lower risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, and premature death.Although eating more vegetables is better, you dont have to go from zero to nine servings a day. Perhaps your goal is eating one serving of vegetables at dinner. If you already do that, consider eating one vegetable or fruit at every meal.Keep in mind that less-processed veggies are better. Rather than fries, try roasted potatoes seasoned with herbs or make a stir-fry of several colorful vegetables and drizzle them with a tasty vinaigrette.2. Swap in whole grainsReplacing refined grains with whole grains will benefit your health. In a small 2017 study, 81 men and postmenopausal women were divided into two groups. Half followed a diet that contained whole grains, and the other half followed a diet that was calorically the same but contained refined grains. After 6 weeks, the whole grain group increased their resting metabolic rate (RMR). RMR is how many calories your body burns at rest.Research from 2016 and 2020 link consuming more whole grains with reduced risk of diabetes, coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.Start small by replacing one refined grain each day with a whole grain maybe its your breakfast toast or the pilaf you make with dinner. Experiment with different grains and flavorings to see which ones you enjoy most.Whole grains include:plain oatswhole grain bread and pastabrown and wild ricebuckwheatbulgur wheatmilletbarleyspeltquinoafarroRefined grains include:white bread and pastawhite ricemost breakfast cerealschipspretzelcrackers3. Be more activeIf the words exercise or workout put you off, think of this step in terms of physical activity or simply moving your body. You dont have to run a marathon or run at all to be healthy.You could walk, go for a bike ride, take salsa dancing lessons, practice martial arts, or try a workout class online. The most important thing is to choose an activity you enjoy. Choosing an activity you have an interest in will increase the chances that youll stick with it.Secondly, remember that you dont have to start with a long workout. Aim for 10 minutes a day, 5 days a week. When you feel ready, add another 5 or 10 minutes. Keep doing this until you reach at least 30 minutes a day most days of the week.4. Maintain friendshipsStrong relationships and staying in communication with friends and loved ones can support mental health.For one, the risk of depression is greater in people with low-quality relationships. Those with the poorest quality social relationships have more than double the risk of depression compared to people with the highest quality connections.Similarly, research suggests feeling isolated is associated with an increased risk of poor self-rated health and depression. It is also associated with various health problems, like headaches, palpitations, and lower back, neck, or shoulder pain.Even if you cannot get together with friends or family in person, schedule a time to catch up over a phone or video call once a week. Or, simply start chatting with a neighbor when you see them.5. Control stressChronic stress puts your body into fight-or-flight mode all the time. This taxes your immune system and makes you more susceptible to health problems, including:heart diseasediabetesdigestive problemsdepressionhigh blood pressureanxietydifficulty sleepingExercise can help reduce stress by releasing pent-up energy. Physical activity can also boost the release of mood-lifting hormones called endorphins.For others, mindfulness practices like meditation, deep breathing, journaling, or spending time in nature can help to lower stress. Talking to friends can also help.If you would like more support relieving stress, consider therapy. Working with a trained psychologist, psychiatrist, or therapist can help you work through challenges life throws your way, and it can help you learn new skills to manage stress.Are there any drawbacks?There really arent any downsides to a healthy lifestyle since each person gets to define what healthy looks and feels like for themselves.This means you dont have to do anything that doesnt make you happy. After all, as we already covered, unhappiness can affect your health. For example, if you dont like conventional exercise, think of ways you enjoy moving your body. And if you hate kale, you dont have to eat it.Does this mean I have to give up my favorite bad habit?Living a healthy lifestyle does not mean you have to give up the things that may be considered bad habits. Its perfectly possible to balance healthy living with eating cookies, taking a day off from your workout, or having wine with dinner.In fact, enjoying a treat once in a while can help you better stick to healthy eating habits. An all-or-nothing mindset where you can only eat good foods and never eat bad ones often backfires. Having the flexibility to eat your moms extra-cheesy lasagna and savor every bite is part of being healthy.Rest days are also important for physical and mental health. Doing too much exercise can increase the risk of injuries or cause you to burn out and give up exercise altogether.Furthermore, moderate drinking (one standard-size drink per day for women and two for men) is linked with various health benefits. A standard drink is:12 fluid ounces of beer5 fl oz of wine89 fl oz of malt liquor1.5 fl oz of spiritOn the other hand, if you feel as though you cant control a habit that might bring negative health effects (such as drinking alcohol, using recreational drugs in excess, or smoking), talk to your doctor. They can help you find support.The bottom lineA healthy lifestyle can not only help you feel better, but it can also reduce the risk of some diseases, lengthen your lifespan, save you money, and benefit the environment.Your version of a healthy lifestyle is whatever you define it to be. Theres nothing you must or must not do in order to be healthy. Identify what makes you feel good and what brings you the greatest happiness. Then, start small when you make changes. Youre more likely to see success this way, and small successes will snowball into bigger benefits.Lastly, if you want help with making any lifestyle changes, talk to your doctor. If they cant directly help you, they may recommend other professionals, like registered dietitians or therapists.Brittany Risher is a writer, editor, and digital strategist specializing in health and lifestyle content.

Being healthy includes healthy eating, physical activities, weight management, and stress management. A healthy lifestyle includes a balanced diet. This does not mean cutting out important food groups from your diet or limiting yourself on the amount of calories per day. A well-rounded diet involves eating most food groups in every meal. Meats, dairy, fruits, and vegetables are all important components of a meal that will ensure your body is healthy. Components of a healthy lifestyle[change | change source] A healthy lifestyle is mostly associated with: Good diet Physical exercise Good sleeping pattern Personal hygiene No bad habits or addiction Health education Safe environment Physical fitness Love through social support and healthy relationships Emotions Active social life References[change | change source] Participants at the 6th Global Conference on Health Promotion.

Eat a variety of foods For good health, we need more than 40 different nutrients, and no single food can supply them all. It is not about a single meal, it is about a balanced food choice over time that will make a difference!A high-fat lunch could be followed by a low-fat dinner.After a large meat portion at dinner, perhaps fish should be the next days choice?Top of the page2. Base your diet on plenty of foods rich in carbohydratesAbout half the calories in our diet should come from foods rich in carbohydrates, such as cereals, rice, pasta, potatoes, and bread. It is a good idea to include at least one of these at every meal. Wholegrain foods, like wholegrain bread, pasta, and cereals, will increase our fibre intake.Top of the page 3. Replace saturated with unsaturated fatFats are important for good health and proper functioning of the body. However, too much of it can negatively affect our weight and cardiovascular health. Different kinds of fats have different health effects, and some of these tips could help us keep the balance right:We should limit the consumption of total and saturated fats (often coming from foods of animal origin), and completely avoid trans fats; reading the labels helps to identify the sources.Eating fish 2-3 times a week, with at least one serving of oily fish, will contribute to our right intake of unsaturated fats.When cooking, we should boil, steam or bake, rather than frying, remove the fatty part of meat, use vegetable oils.Top of the page4. Enjoy plenty of fruits and vegetablesFruits and vegetables are among the most important foods for giving us enough vitamins, minerals and fibre. We should try to eat at least 5 servings a day. For example, a glass of fresh fruit juice at breakfast, perhaps an apple and a piece of watermelon as snacks, and a good portion of different vegetables at each meal.Top of the page5. Reduce salt and sugar intakeA high salt intake can result in high blood pressure, and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. There are different ways to reduce salt in the diet:When shopping, we could choose products with lower sodium content.When cooking, salt can be substituted with spices, increasing the variety of flavours and tastes.When eating, it helps not to have salt at the table, or at least not to add salt before tasting.Sugar provides sweetness and an attractive taste, but sugary foods and drinks are rich in energy, and are best enjoyed in moderation, as an occasional treat. We could use fruits instead, even to sweeten our foods and drinks.Top of the page6. Eat regularly, control the portion sizeEating a variety of foods, regularly, and in the right amounts is the best formula for a healthy diet.Skipping meals, especially breakfast, can lead to out-of-control hunger, often resulting in helpless overeating. Snacking between meals can help control hunger, but snacking should not replace proper meals. For snacks, we could choose yoghurt, a handful of fresh or dried fruits or vegetables (like carrot sticks), unsalted nuts, or perhaps some bread with cheese.Paying attention to portion size will help us not to consume too much calories, and will allow us to eat all the foods we enjoy, without having to eliminate any.Cooking the right amount makes it easier to not overeat.Some reasonable serving sizes are: 100 g of meat; one medium piece of fruit; half a cup of raw pasta.Using smaller plates helps with smaller servings.Packaged foods, with calorie values on the pack, could aid portion control.If eating out, we could share a portion with a friend.Top of the page7. Drink plenty of fluidsAdults need to drink at least 1.5 litres of fluid a day! Or more if it's very hot or they are physically active. Water is the best source, of course, and we can use tap or mineral water, sparkling or non-sparkling, plain or flavoured. Fruit juices, tea, soft drinks, milk and other drinks, can all be okay - from time to time.Top of the page8. Maintain a healthy body weightThe right weight for each us depends on factors like our gender, height, age, and genes. Being affected by obesity and overweight increases the risks of a wide range of diseases, including diabetes, heart diseases, and cancer.Excess body fat comes from eating more than we need. The extra calories can come from any caloric nutrient - protein, fat, carbohydrate, or alcohol, but fat is the most concentrated source of energy. Physical activity helps us spend the energy, and makes us feel good. The message is reasonably simple: if we are gaining weight, we need to eat less and be more active!Top of the page9. Get on the move, make it a habit!Physical activity is important for people of all weight ranges and health conditions. It helps us burn off the extra calories, it is good for the heart and circulatory system, it maintains or increases our muscle mass, it helps us focus, and improves overall health well-being. We don't have to be top athletes to get on the move! 150 minutes per week of moderate physical activity is advised, and it can easily become part of our daily routine. We all could:use the stairs instead of the elevator,go for a walk during lunch breaks (and stretch in our offices in between)make time for a family weekend activityTop of the page10. Start now! And keep changing gradually.Gradual changes in our lifestyle are easier to maintain than major changes introduced all at once. For three days, we could write down the foods and drinks we consume throughout the day, and make a note of the amount of movement we made. It wont be difficult to spot where we could improve:Skipping breakfast? A small bowl of muesli, a piece of bread or fruit, could help slowly introduce it into our routineToo few fruits and vegetables? To start with, we can introduce one extra piece a day.Favourite foods high in fat? Eliminating them abruptly could fire back, and make us return to the old habits. We can choose low fat options instead, eat them less frequently, and in smaller portions.Too little activity? Using the stairs daily could be a great first move.Top of the page You may also like...

Will miscarriage care remain available? / Staying Healthy Healthy lifestyle: 5 keys to a longer life March 25, 2020 By Monique Tello, MD, MPH, Contributor How is it that the United States spends the most money on healthcare, and yet still has the one of the lowest life expectancies of all developed nations? (To be specific: $9,400 per capita, 79 years, and 31st.) Maybe those of us in healthcare have been looking at it all wrong, for too long. Healthy lifestyle and longevity Researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health conducted a massive study of the impact of health habits on life expectancy, using data from the well-known Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS). This means that they had data on a huge number of people over a very long period of time. The NHS included over 78,000 women and followed them from 1980 to 2014. The HPFS included over 40,000 men and followed them from 1986 to 2014. This is over 120,000 participants, 34 years of data for women, and 28 years of data for men. The researchers looked at NHS and HPFS data on diet, physical activity, body weight, smoking, and alcohol consumption that had been collected from regularly administered, validated questionnaires. What is a healthy lifestyle, exactly? These five areas were chosen because prior studies have shown them to have a large impact on risk of premature death. Here is how these healthy habits were defined and measured: 1. Healthy diet, which was calculated and rated based on the reported intake of healthy foods like vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, healthy fats, and omega-3 fatty acids, and unhealthy foods like red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages, trans fat, and sodium. 2. Healthy physical activity level, which was measured as at least 30 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous activity daily. 3. Healthy body weight, defined as a normal body mass index (BMI), which is between 18.5 and 24.9. 4. Smoking, well, there is no healthy amount of smoking. "Healthy" here meant never having smoked. 5. Moderate alcohol intake, which was measured as between 5 and 15 grams per day for women, and 5 to 30 grams per day for men. Generally, one drink contains about 14 grams of pure alcohol. That's 12 ounces of regular beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits. Researchers also looked at data on age, ethnicity, and medication use, as well as comparison data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research. Does a healthy lifestyle make a difference? As it turns out, healthy habits make a big difference. According to this analysis, people who met criteria for all five habits enjoyed significantly, impressively longer lives than those who had none: 14 years for women and 12 years for men (if they had these habits at age 50). People who had none of these habits were far more likely to die prematurely from cancer or cardiovascular disease. Study investigators also calculated life expectancy by how many of these five healthy habits people had. Just one healthy habit (and it didn't matter which one) ... just one... extended life expectancy by two years in men and women. Not surprisingly, the more healthy habits people had, the longer their lifespan. This is one of those situations where I wish I could reprint their graphs for you, because they're so cool. (But if you're very curious, the article is available online, and the graphs are on page 7. Check out Graph B, "Estimated life expectancy at age 50 according to the number of low-risk factors.") This is huge. And, it confirms prior similar research a lot of prior similar research. A 2017 study using data from the Health and Retirement Study found that people 50 and older who were normal weight, had never smoked, and drank alcohol in moderation lived on average seven years longer. A 2012 mega-analysis of 15 international studies that included over 500,000 participants found that over half of premature deaths were due to unhealthy lifestyle factors such as poor diet, inactivity, obesity, excessive alcohol intake, and smoking. And the list of supporting research goes on. So what's our (big) problem? As the authors of this study point out, in the US we tend to spend outlandishly on developing fancy drugs and other treatments for diseases, rather than on trying to prevent them. This is a big problem. Experts have suggested that the best way to help people make healthy diet and lifestyle change is at the large-scale, population level, through public health efforts and policy changes. (Kind of like motorcycle helmets and seat belt legislation...) We have made a little progress with tobacco and trans-fat legislation. There's a lot of pushback from big industry on that, of course. If we have guidelines and laws helping us to live healthier, big companies aren't going to sell as much fast food, chips, and soda. And for companies hell-bent on making money at the cost of human life, well, that makes them very angry.

You may simply feel off. You may find that you feel tired, your digestive system isnt functioning as well as it normally does, and you seem to catch colds. Mentally, you may find you cant concentrate and feel anxious or depressed.The good news: a healthy lifestyle can help you feel better. Even better, you dont have to overhaul your entire life overnight. Its pretty easy to make a couple of small changes that can steer you in the direction of improved well-being. And once you make one change, that success can motivate you to continue to make more positive shifts.What is a healthy lifestyle?Ask 50 people to define what a healthy lifestyle is, and youll likely get 50 different answers. Thats because theres no one way to be healthy. A healthy lifestyle simply means doing things that make you happy and feel good.For one person, that may mean walking a mile five times a week, eating fast food once a week, and spending virtual or in-person time with loved ones every other day. For someone else, a healthy lifestyle may be training and running two marathons a year, following a keto diet, and never having a sip of alcohol.Neither of these is better than the other. Both are perfect for that person. You get to decide what your healthy lifestyle looks like.How is it beneficial?Making changes to improve your health can lead to benefits for your body, your mind, your wallet, and even the environment.1. Prevents diseaseHealthy habits can reduce the risk of various diseases, including those that may run in your family.For example, in a recent study, adults who followed a standard American diet (rich in fruits and vegetables) for 8 weeks had a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.In another 2020 study, researchers found that every 66-gram increase in daily fruit and vegetable intake was associated with a 25 percent lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes.Swapping out some refined grains for whole grains also reduces the risk of disease. In an observational study of almost 200,000 adults, those who ate the most whole grains had a 29 percent lower rate of type 2 diabetes than those who ate the least.And a review of 45 studies concluded that eating 90 grams (or three 30-gram servings) of whole grains daily reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease by 22 percent, coronary heart disease by 19 percent, and cancer by 15 percent.In terms of exercise, as little as 11 minutes a day may add years to your life. In a 2020 study, researchers tracked more than 44,000 adults. Those who got 11 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity each day had a lower risk of death compared to those who only exercised at that intensity for 2 minutes. This comparison held true even if people sat for 8.5 hours every day.2. Saves moneyIts always smart to see your primary care physician for an annual physical exam. This is especially true seeing how some health conditions, such as high blood pressure, are silent. This means they dont have any symptoms, so unless you are checked, you usually dont know you have the condition.However, the healthier you are, the less likely you will have to see a doctor. This could save money by reducing co-pays, the need for prescriptions, and other treatments.3. Lengthens lifespanBasic healthy habits are connected with living a longer life. If, at age 50, youve never smoked, maintain a healthy weight, are regularly active, follow a healthy diet, and keep alcohol to a moderate consumption, you could live up to 14 years longer. Making even a few of these changes could lengthen your lifespan.4. It can be good for the environmentUltra-processed foods are those that contain refined grains and additives to change the texture, taste, or color. Some examples of these foods are cheese puffs, packaged dessert cakes, chicken nuggets, and sweetened breakfast cereals. More than 70 percent of foods in U.S. supermarkets are ultra-processed.The making of ultra-processed foods contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, water scarcity, decreased biodiversity, plastic waste, and deforestation.Then, there are animal products. According to a 2013 study by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (an agency within the U.N. that focuses on reducing hunger and food inequality worldwide), raising livestock for meat and dairy makes up 14.5 percent of human-created greenhouse gases. However, there are easy fixes for this. For example, if every American cut their weekly beef consumption by 1/4 pound, the decrease in global warming gas emissions would be the equivalent of taking four to six million cars off the road, according to the National Resources Defense Council.But its not only about what you eat more or less of. Replacing short car rides with biking can also cut back on the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere.In a non-peer reviewed 2010 study, researchers estimated that if 20 percent of citizens in Madison, Wisconsin biked for trips less than 5 miles, it would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 57,000 tons each year.And, a 2017 study in Stockholm found that, if drivers who lived within a half-hour bike ride to and from work commuted by bike rather than car, it could save 449 years of life annually in the county due to reduced vehicle emission.These estimates arent simply dreams. Barcelonas bike-share program reduces emissions of carbon dioxide by about 10,000 tons each year.What is the easiest way to start one?Your journey toward a healthier lifestyle starts with small changes that you feel confident you can achieve. Consider making SMART goals. SMART stands for:specificmeasurableattainablerelevanttime-bound (met by a deadline and done in a certain amount of time)When you focus on SMART goals, you could find more success. And one initial win will propel you to set new, bigger goals.Consider the following tips for beginning to improve your overall health.1. Eat more vegetablesA 2010 analysis of prospective studies suggests consuming more veggies and fruit is associated with lower risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, and premature death.Although eating more vegetables is better, you dont have to go from zero to nine servings a day. Perhaps your goal is eating one serving of vegetables at dinner. If you already do that, consider eating one vegetable or fruit at every meal.Keep in mind that less-processed veggies are better. Rather than fries, try roasted potatoes seasoned with herbs or make a stir-fry of several colorful vegetables and drizzle them with a tasty vinaigrette.2. Swap in whole grainsReplacing refined grains with whole grains will benefit your health. In a small 2017 study, 81 men and postmenopausal women were divided into two groups. Half followed a diet that contained whole grains, and the other half followed a diet that was calorically the same but contained refined grains. After 6 weeks, the whole grain group increased their resting metabolic rate (RMR). RMR is how many calories your body burns at rest.Research from 2016 and 2020 link consuming more whole grains with reduced risk of diabetes, coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.Start small by replacing one refined grain each day with a whole grain maybe its your breakfast toast or the pilaf you make with dinner. Experiment with different grains and flavorings to see which ones you enjoy most.Whole grains include:plain oatswhole grain bread and pastabrown and wild ricebuckwheatbulgur wheatmilletbarleyspeltquinoafarroRefined grains include:white bread and pastawhite ricemost breakfast cerealschipspretzelcrackers3. Be more activeIf the words exercise or workout put you off, think of this step in terms of physical activity or simply moving your body. You dont have to run a marathon or run at all to be healthy.You could walk, go for a bike ride, take salsa dancing lessons, practice martial arts, or try a workout class online. The most important thing is to choose an activity you enjoy. Choosing an activity you have an interest in will increase the chances that youll stick with it.Secondly, remember that you dont have to start with a long workout. Aim for 10 minutes a day, 5 days a week. When you feel ready, add another 5 or 10 minutes. Keep doing this until you reach at least 30 minutes a day most days of the week.4. Maintain friendshipsStrong relationships and staying in communication with friends and loved ones can support mental health.For one, the risk of depression is greater in people with low-quality relationships. Those with the poorest quality social relationships have more than double the risk of depression compared to people with the highest quality connections.Similarly, research suggests feeling isolated is associated with an increased risk of poor self-rated health and depression. It is also associated with various health problems, like headaches, palpitations, and lower back, neck, or shoulder pain.Even if you cannot get together with friends or family in person, schedule a time to catch up over a phone or video call once a week. Or, simply start chatting with a neighbor when you see them.5. Control stressChronic stress puts your body into fight-or-flight mode all the time. This taxes your immune system and makes you more susceptible to health problems, including:heart diseasediabetesdigestive problemsdepressionhigh blood pressureanxietydifficulty sleepingExercise can help reduce stress by releasing pent-up energy. Physical activity can also boost the release of mood-lifting hormones called endorphins.For others, mindfulness practices like meditation, deep breathing, journaling, or spending time in nature can help to lower stress. Talking to friends can also help.If you would like more support relieving stress, consider therapy. Working with a trained psychologist, psychiatrist, or therapist can help you work through challenges life throws your way, and it can help you learn new skills to manage stress.Are there any drawbacks?There really arent any downsides to a healthy lifestyle since each person gets to define what healthy looks and feels like for themselves.This means you dont have to do anything that doesnt make you happy. After all, as we already covered, unhappiness can affect your health. For example, if you dont like conventional exercise, think of ways you enjoy moving your body. And if you hate kale, you dont have to eat it.Does this mean I have to give up my favorite bad habit?Living a healthy lifestyle does not mean you have to give up the things that may be considered bad habits. Its perfectly possible to balance healthy living with eating cookies, taking a day off from your workout, or having wine with dinner.In fact, enjoying a treat once in a while can help you better stick to healthy eating habits. An all-or-nothing mindset where you can only eat good foods and never eat bad ones often backfires. Having the flexibility to eat your moms extra-cheesy lasagna and savor every bite is part of being healthy.Rest days are also important for physical and mental health. Doing too much exercise can increase the risk of injuries or cause you to burn out and give up exercise altogether.Furthermore, moderate drinking (one standard-size drink per day for women and two for men) is linked with various health benefits. A standard drink is:12 fluid ounces of beer5 fl oz of wine89 fl oz of malt liquor1.5 fl oz of spiritOn the other hand, if you feel as though you cant control a habit that might bring negative health effects (such as drinking alcohol, using recreational drugs in excess, or smoking), talk to your doctor. They can help you find support.The bottom lineA healthy lifestyle can not only help you feel better, but it can also reduce the risk of some diseases, lengthen your lifespan, save you money, and benefit the environment.Your version of a healthy lifestyle is whatever you define it to be. Theres nothing you must or must not do in order to be healthy. Identify what makes you feel good and what brings you the greatest happiness. Then, start small when you make changes. Youre more likely to see success this way, and small successes will snowball into bigger benefits.Lastly, if you want help with making any lifestyle changes, talk to your doctor. If they cant directly help you, they may recommend other professionals, like registered dietitians or therapists.Brittany Risher is a writer, editor, and digital strategist specializing in health and lifestyle content.

Being healthy includes healthy eating, physical activities, weight management, and stress management. A healthy lifestyle includes a balanced diet. This does not mean cutting out important food groups from your diet or limiting yourself on the amount of calories per day. A well-rounded diet involves eating most food groups in every meal. Meats, dairy, fruits, and vegetables are all important components of a meal that will ensure your body is healthy. Components of a healthy lifestyle[change | change source] A healthy lifestyle is mostly associated with: Good diet Physical exercise Good sleeping pattern Personal hygiene No bad habits or addiction Health education Safe environment Physical fitness Love through social support and healthy relationships Emotions Active social life References[change | change source] Participants at the 6th Global Conference on Health Promotion.

Eat a variety of foods For good health, we need more than 40 different nutrients, and no single food can supply them all. It is not about a single meal, it is about a balanced food choice over time that will make a difference!A high-fat lunch could be followed by a low-fat dinner.After a large meat portion at dinner, perhaps fish should be the next days choice?Top of the page2. Base your diet on plenty of foods rich in carbohydratesAbout half the calories in our diet should come from foods rich in carbohydrates, such as cereals, rice, pasta, potatoes, and bread. It is a good idea to include at least one of these at every meal. Wholegrain foods, like wholegrain bread, pasta, and cereals, will increase our fibre intake.Top of the page 3. Replace saturated with unsaturated fatFats are important for good health and proper functioning of the body. However, too much of it can negatively affect our weight and cardiovascular health. Different kinds of fats have different health effects, and some of these tips could help us keep the balance right:We should limit the consumption of total and saturated fats (often coming from foods of animal origin), and completely avoid trans fats; reading the labels helps to identify the sources.Eating fish 2-3 times a week, with at least one serving of oily fish, will contribute to our right intake of unsaturated fats.When cooking, we should boil, steam or bake, rather than frying, remove the fatty part of meat, use vegetable oils.Top of the page4. Enjoy plenty of fruits and vegetablesFruits and vegetables are among the most important foods for giving us enough vitamins, minerals and fibre. We should try to eat at least 5 servings a day. For example, a glass of fresh fruit juice at breakfast, perhaps an apple and a piece of watermelon as snacks, and a good portion of different vegetables at each meal.Top of the page5. Reduce salt and sugar intakeA high salt intake can result in high blood pressure, and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. There are different ways to reduce salt in the diet:When shopping, we could choose products with lower sodium content.When cooking, salt can be substituted with spices, increasing the variety of flavours and tastes.When eating, it helps not to have salt at the table, or at least not to add salt before tasting.Sugar provides sweetness and an attractive taste, but sugary foods and drinks are rich in energy, and are best enjoyed in moderation, as an occasional treat. We could use fruits instead, even to sweeten our foods and drinks.Top of the page6. Eat regularly, control the portion sizeEating a variety of foods, regularly, and in the right amounts is the best formula for a healthy diet.Skipping meals, especially breakfast, can lead to out-of-control hunger, often resulting in helpless overeating. Snacking between meals can help control hunger, but snacking should not replace proper meals. For snacks, we could choose yoghurt, a handful of fresh or dried fruits or vegetables (like carrot sticks), unsalted nuts, or perhaps some bread with cheese.Paying attention to portion size will help us not to consume too much calories, and will allow us to eat all the foods we enjoy, without having to eliminate any.Cooking the right amount makes it easier to not overeat.Some reasonable serving sizes are: 100 g of meat; one medium piece of fruit; half a cup of raw pasta.Using smaller plates helps with smaller servings.Packaged foods, with calorie values on the pack, could aid portion control.If eating out, we could share a portion with a friend.Top of the page7. Drink plenty of fluidsAdults need to drink at least 1.5 litres of fluid a day! Or more if it's very hot or they are physically active. Water is the best source, of course, and we can use tap or mineral water, sparkling or non-sparkling, plain or flavoured. Fruit juices, tea, soft drinks, milk and other drinks, can all be okay - from time to time.Top of the page8. Maintain a healthy body weightThe right weight for each us depends on factors like our gender, height, age, and genes. Being affected by obesity and overweight increases the risks of a wide range of diseases, including diabetes, heart diseases, and cancer.Excess body fat comes from eating more than we need. The extra calories can come from any caloric nutrient - protein, fat, carbohydrate, or alcohol, but fat is the most concentrated source of energy. Physical activity helps us spend the energy, and makes us feel good. The message is reasonably simple: if we are gaining weight, we need to eat less and be more active!Top of the page9. Get on the move, make it a habit!Physical activity is important for people of all weight ranges and health conditions. It helps us burn off the extra calories, it is good for the heart and circulatory system, it maintains or increases our muscle mass, it helps us focus, and improves overall health well-being. We don't have to be top athletes to get on the move! 150 minutes per week of moderate physical activity is advised, and it can easily become part of our daily routine. We all could:use the stairs instead of the elevator,go for a walk during lunch breaks (and stretch in our offices in between)make time for a family weekend activityTop of the page10. Start now! And keep changing gradually.Gradual changes in our lifestyle are easier to maintain than major changes introduced all at once. For three days, we could write down the foods and drinks we consume throughout the day, and make a note of the amount of movement we made. It wont be difficult to spot where we could improve:Skipping breakfast? A small bowl of muesli, a piece of bread or fruit, could help slowly introduce it into our routineToo few fruits and vegetables? To start with, we can introduce one extra piece a day.Favourite foods high in fat? Eliminating them abruptly could fire back, and make us return to the old habits. We can choose low fat options instead, eat them less frequently, and in smaller portions.Too little activity? Using the stairs daily could be a great first move.Top of the page You may also like...
