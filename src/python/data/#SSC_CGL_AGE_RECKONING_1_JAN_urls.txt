Hashtags such as #SSC_CGL_Age_Reckoninh_1_JAN and #SSC_CGL_1JAN are trending on the Microblogging site - Twitter. Aspirants have been protesting outside the CGO Complex since Tuesday, and have also written to Union Minister of State Jitendra Singh, the Minister In-Charge of the Department of Personnel and Training(DoPT), requesting that the age cut-off date be changed from August 1 to January 1, 2023. While acknowledging the problems the students are facing, Pradeep Rawat, Parent & Founder, Gurgaon Parents Association took to Twitter and wrote, "The unexpected Sudden Change in age reckoning date by SSC has snatched away the last chance of thousands of Job seekers, Age reckoning date should be Jan_1 instead of Aug_1 as it was in previous years mostly. #SSC_CGL_1JAN Help Aspirants please @DrJitendraSingh @DoPTGoI."

Last year, the age limit for the competitive examination was calculated as of January 1, 2023. However, due to this year's abrupt change in the cut-off date, several aspirants will be ineligible for the exam. What Does Commission Say in Official Notification?"The candidates who have appeared in their final year of their graduation can also apply, however they must possess Essential qualification on or before the cut-off date i.e. 01-08-2023," reads the official notification.

Previous Next SSC CGL Exam 2023: Several Rendered Ineligible After Sudden Change In Age Cut-Off Date, Aspirants Awaits Commission Response India.com 23-04-2023 support@india.com (India.com News Desk) Sumaila Zaman #SSC_CGL_AGE_RECKONING_1_JAN Issue: A large section of students from different cities along with the All India Student's Union (AISU) is requesting a modification in the Staff Selection Commission Combined Graduate Level (SSC CGL 2023) age cut-off date. Hashtags such as #SSC_CGL_Age_Reckoninh_1_JAN and #SSC_CGL_1JAN are trending on the Microblogging site - Twitter. Aspirants have been protesting outside the CGO Complex since Tuesday, and have also written to Union Minister of State Jitendra Singh, the Minister In-Charge of the Department of Personnel and Training(DoPT), requesting that the age cut-off date be changed from August 1 to January 1, 2023. While acknowledging the problems the students are facing, Pradeep Rawat, Parent & Founder, Gurgaon Parents Association took to Twitter and wrote, "The unexpected Sudden Change in age reckoning date by SSC has snatched away the last chance of thousands of Job seekers, Age reckoning date should be Jan_1 instead of Aug_1 as it was in previous years mostly. #SSC_CGL_1JAN Help Aspirants please @DrJitendraSingh @DoPTGoI." Why are SSC Aspirants demanding the Change in CGL Age Cut off Date?Following the announcement of the SSC CGL exam notification, the students demanded the Commission to revise the date of SSC CGL 2023 age eligibility. The Commission has set August 1, 2023, as the age recognition date to ensure the age limit criteria for recruitment to various positions. Last year, the age limit for the competitive examination was calculated as of January 1, 2023. However, due to this year's abrupt change in the cut-off date, several aspirants will be ineligible for the exam. What Does Commission Say in Official Notification?"The candidates who have appeared in their final year of their graduation can also apply, however they must possess Essential qualification on or before the cut-off date i.e. 01-08-2023," reads the official notification. Here's how students have been reacting. Check the tweets below.

While acknowledging the problems the students are facing, Pradeep Rawat, Parent & Founder, Gurgaon Parents Association took to Twitter and wrote, "The unexpected Sudden Change in age reckoning date by SSC has snatched away the last chance of thousands of Job seekers, Age reckoning date should be Jan_1 instead of Aug_1 as it was in previous years mostly. #SSC_CGL_1JAN Help Aspirants please @DrJitendraSingh @DoPTGoI."

Previous Next SSC CGL Exam 2023: Several Rendered Ineligible After Sudden Change In Age Cut-Off Date, Aspirants Awaits Commission Response India.com 23-04-2023 support@india.com (India.com News Desk) Sumaila Zaman #SSC_CGL_AGE_RECKONING_1_JAN Issue: A large section of students from different cities along with the All India Student's Union (AISU) is requesting a modification in the Staff Selection Commission Combined Graduate Level (SSC CGL 2023) age cut-off date. Hashtags such as #SSC_CGL_Age_Reckoninh_1_JAN and #SSC_CGL_1JAN are trending on the Microblogging site - Twitter. Aspirants have been protesting outside the CGO Complex since Tuesday, and have also written to Union Minister of State Jitendra Singh, the Minister In-Charge of the Department of Personnel and Training(DoPT), requesting that the age cut-off date be changed from August 1 to January 1, 2023. While acknowledging the problems the students are facing, Pradeep Rawat, Parent & Founder, Gurgaon Parents Association took to Twitter and wrote, "The unexpected Sudden Change in age reckoning date by SSC has snatched away the last chance of thousands of Job seekers, Age reckoning date should be Jan_1 instead of Aug_1 as it was in previous years mostly. #SSC_CGL_1JAN Help Aspirants please @DrJitendraSingh @DoPTGoI." Why are SSC Aspirants demanding the Change in CGL Age Cut off Date?Following the announcement of the SSC CGL exam notification, the students demanded the Commission to revise the date of SSC CGL 2023 age eligibility. The Commission has set August 1, 2023, as the age recognition date to ensure the age limit criteria for recruitment to various positions. Last year, the age limit for the competitive examination was calculated as of January 1, 2023. However, due to this year's abrupt change in the cut-off date, several aspirants will be ineligible for the exam. What Does Commission Say in Official Notification?"The candidates who have appeared in their final year of their graduation can also apply, however they must possess Essential qualification on or before the cut-off date i.e. 01-08-2023," reads the official notification. Here's how students have been reacting. Check the tweets below.

Due to this given date for counting age, SSC aspirants whose age is on the verge of crossing the age limit are upset. FPJ Education DeskUpdated: Friday, April 07, 2023, 03:36 PM IST SSC CGL 2023 application process commenced at ssc.nic.in | Official New Delhi: SSC has released the notification for SSC CGL 2023 exam on 3rd April 2023. After the notification is out, many users on the microblogging site are demanding to change the age cutoff date for SSC CGL 2023 from 1st Aug to 1st Jan. #SSC_CGL_AGE_RECKONING_1_JAN is trending on twitter by the SSC aspirants and others who supports them.In the notification, the age limit for SSC CGL 2023 is between 18 and 32, and further it says, the age limit will be counted for SSC CGL 2023 exam as on 1st August 2023. Due to this given date for counting age, SSC aspirants whose age is on the verge of crossing the age limit are upset. The reason being usually, SSC counts the 1st of January of the year as the limit for age eligibility. In this case, a lot of candidates find themselves ineligible, or losing one attempt. This has proven especially detrimental to those having SSC CGL 2023 as their last attempt at cracking the exam.Many twitter users have urged SSC to change the age reckoning date. Here are few of them. For many years SSC was giving age reckoning as 1st January.The surprise change to 1-Aug-2023 will cause lakhs of students lose last chance. We request SSC to change it to 1-Jan-2023 immediately for SSC CGL 2023 aspirant.#SSC_CGL_AGE_RECKONING_1_JAN@DoPTGoI RaMo (@RaMoSirOfficial) April 7, 2023 change the age reckoning date for SSC CGL 2023 from 1st Aug to 1st Jan 2023 #SSC_CGL_AGE_RECKONING_1_JAN Abhinay Maths (@abhinaymaths) April 7, 2023 I urge the government to change the age reckoning date for SSC CGL 2023 from 1st Aug to 1st Jan 2023. pic.twitter.com/5bSmW6BMUZ Awadh Ojha Sir Parody (@AwadhOjhaSir) April 7, 2023 Sudden change why...It's a kind request toSSC for SSC CGl 2023.

While acknowledging the problems the students are facing, Pradeep Rawat, Parent & Founder, Gurgaon Parents Association took to Twitter and wrote, "The unexpected Sudden Change in age reckoning date by SSC has snatched away the last chance of thousands of Job seekers, Age reckoning date should be Jan_1 instead of Aug_1 as it was in previous years mostly. #SSC_CGL_1JAN Help Aspirants please @DrJitendraSingh @DoPTGoI."
